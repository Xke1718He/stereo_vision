  * description: This is a master student project realized at the robotics laboratory of the Westphalian University of Applied Science. With the programs in this repository you can calibrate single cameras, a stereo system, calculate disparity maps and evaluate your data. It's a all in one package for stereo vision! The software runs under windows and linux and is written in C++.
